# Experimental Repository

This repository is purely **experimental**. The content here represents my personal learning and testing of CI pipelines, driver modifications, and shader patches. It is **not intended for production use**, and I do **not recommend using it as a base for real projects**.  

This work helped me understand:   
- CI builds.

If you are looking for high-performance, professionally maintained drivers, check out these repositories:  

- [AdrenoToolsDrivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers)  
- [freedreno_turnip-CI](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/freedreno_turnip-CI)

Thank you for visiting! This repository is just a **sandbox** for learning and experimentation.
